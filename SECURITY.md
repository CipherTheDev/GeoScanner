## Reporting a Vulnerability

You may report a vulnerbility if it affects on how the API works in a whole.

This may include such as  Buffer Overflows and/or dangerous ones that may effect you as well.

In order to report a vulnerbility please open an issue discussing it fully and/or how you discovered it.
#### Vulnerbility updates

You can expect an update every once per month until the full API is updated along with the documentation unless a
vulnerbility is such important that it may require an instant update within a week.
This is done for your security and safety.

A vulnerbility is accepted only if you had wrote a report with it and/or have explained in depth of how it may affect the API.
This also includes images, videos and much more.
#### Declined Vulnerbilities

Some will be ignored and declined if they lack the support of evidence and/or penetration testing reports.

This includes false reports that then will result the case being closed.
