# Remake of Max Mind's old project

This project is in development, when free i will begin updating each .py file for all security professionals to enjoy a newer pygeoip with a newer documentation instead of the new one that requires a license.

[Constantly updated to a better version]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following project is outdated but is now being updated constantly to allow cyber security consultants to easily use the API without the requirement of purchasing the Version 2.

# Pure Python GeoIP API

This library is based on [Maxmind's GeoIP C API](https://github.com/maxmind/geoip-api-c).

Tested with Python version 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3 , 3.4 and 3.6.
