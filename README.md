# Remake of Max Mind's old project

This project is in development, when free i will begin updating each .py file for all security professionals to enjoy a newer pygeoip with a newer documentation instead of the new one that requires a license.

## This project will soon have it's own method  of tracking people

This means that professionals will be able to perform easier methods of tracking phones, laptops and etc.

[Constantly updated to a better version]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following project is being updated constantly to allow cyber security consultants to easily use the API without the requirement of purchasing the Version 2.

It will however have a different database and/or syntax to it.
# Pure Python GeoIP API

Tested with Python version 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3 , 3.4 ,3.6 and 3.7.
